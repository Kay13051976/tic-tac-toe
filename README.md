The TicTacToe is a Python terminal project to foster social interaction development.TicTacToe can be used to promote several cognitive skills, including counting and spatial skills and colour and shape identification. It helps develop essential strategic thinking and planning skills. It serves as a foundation for more complex strategy games and can provide entertainment and mental stimulation for people of all ages. It reinforces basic math skills. While Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game, it can be a valuable tool for learning. 
Users can quickly learn the game's rules and which side they want to be on. They should continue playing the game or stop after the match ends according to the instructions.

## How to play:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to be the first to get three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here are the basic instructions to play Tic-Tac-Toe:
 1. Click this[link]() or copy this text (game link from Heroku)and paste it into your browser's address bar.
 2. When the page is loaded, click 'RUN PROGRAM'.
 3. Learn the rules.
 4. Two players typically play tic-tac-toe. One player takes "X," and the other takes "O". Pick the side they want to be on according to the instruction
 5. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in any empty grid cell.
 6. Three in a row horizontally (across the top, middle, or bottom row).
Three in a row vertically (along the left, centre, or right column).
Three in a row diagonally (from the top-left to the bottom-right or from the top-right to the bottom-left).
Ending the Game:
7. The game ends when one player wins by achieving a winning combination. The game ends in a draw (a "cat's game") if all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won. In this case, the game is considered a tie. Announcing the Winner: If a player wins, they announce their victory by saying, "I win!" or "Tic-Tac-Toe!"
8. Playing Again: Players can choose to play multiple rounds or start a new game after the current game ends.

Remember that Tic-Tac-Toe is a game with a limited number of possible moves, and with experienced players, it often ends in a draw.
