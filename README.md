The link to TicTacToe 
The TicTacToe is a Python terminal project to foster social interaction development.TicTacToe can be used to promote several cognitive skills, including counting and spatial skills and colour and shape identification. It helps develop essential strategic thinking and planning skills. It serves as a foundation for more complex strategy games and can provide entertainment and mental stimulation for people of all ages. It reinforces basic math skills. While Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game, it can be a valuable tool for learning. 
Users can quickly learn the game's rules and which side they want to be on. They should continue playing the game or stop after the match ends according to the instructions.[Tic Tac Toe Heroku Link](https://tic-tac-toe-game-by-wanwisa-f2dfdd0abd2a.herokuapp.com/)


## How to play:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to be the first to get three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here are the basic instructions to play Tic-Tac-Toe:
 1. Click this [Tic Tac Toe Heroku Link](https://tic-tac-toe-game-by-wanwisa-f2dfdd0abd2a.herokuapp.com/) or copy this text ****https://tic-tac-toe-game-by-wanwisa-f2dfdd0abd2a.herokuapp.com/**** and paste it into your browser's address bar.
 2. When the page is loaded, click 'RUN PROGRAM'.
 3. Learn the rules.
 4. Two players typically play tic-tac-toe. One player takes "X," and the other takes "O". Pick the side they want to be on according to the instruction
 5. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in any empty grid cell by select the number between 0-8.
 6. Three in a row horizontally (across the top, middle, or bottom row).
Three in a row vertically (along the left, centre, or right column).
Three in a row diagonally (from the top-left to the bottom-right or from the top-right to the bottom-left).
7. The game ends when one player wins by achieving a winning combination. The game ends in a draw, if all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won. In this case, the game is considered a tie. Announcing the Winner: If a player wins, they announce their victory by saying, "X WIN !" or "O WIN !"
8. Playing Again: Human players can choose to stop or continue to play by selecting a simple menu using the arrow up and down to enter Play Again or Quit.

Remember that Tic-Tac-Toe is a game with a limited number of possible moves, and with experienced players, it often ends in a draw.

## Features
- When the program is loaded. The user can see a welcome message that engages them to start playing and instructions describing the game and how to play it.
- Underneath the instruction will show the TicTacToe first game board, which has a number 0-8 in each cell and context to tell the user with a side turn and ask the user to put numbers 0-8.
![image of loaded page](documentation/loading_page.png)
- The user enters the numbers 0-8, and the program will display the game board of the result of two plays between the user(human player) and a random computer player.
- The random computer player will generate to pick the number automatically, then print context to ask the user to add numbers 0-8 again.
![image of print context to ask the user to add number again](documentation/ask_player_to_add_number.png)

- If the user puts the number less than 0, then it will print out a warning that it is an invalid number and tell who turns and puts move(number) again

  ![image warning invalid too small number](documentation/invalid_warning_too_small_number.png)

- If the user puts the number greater than 8, then it will print out a warning that it is an invalid number and tell who turns and puts move(number) again

  ![image warning invalid greater than number](documentation/invalid_warning_too_high_number.png)

- If the user enters the correct number, it will continue to play
  ![image of continue to play when correct number1](documentation/carry_on_playing_if_correct_number.png)

- Announcing the Winner: If any winning Combinations appear: Here are the eight possible ways to win:
    - Three in a row horizontally (across the top, middle, or bottom row).
     ![image row horizontally winning](documentation/row_horizontally_winner.png)
    - Three in a row vertically (along the left, center, or right column).
     ![image of row vertically winning](documentation/row_vertically_winning.png)
    - Three in a row diagonally (from the top-left to the bottom-right or from the top-right to the bottom-left).
     ![image of row diagonally winning](documentation/row_diagonally_winning.png)
- Announce the winner, either X or O and show the user a simple menu to pick whether they want to play again or not.
  ![image of announcing the X winner](documentation/announce_x_winner.png)
  ![image of announcing the O winner](documentation/announce_o_winner.png)

- Announcing the game is tie: If no winning combinations appear.

  ![image of announcing the tie game](documentation/announce_tie_game.png)

## Flowchart
The flowchart represents the logic of the application:

![flowchart image](documentation/flowchart_tactactoe.png)

## Technologies Used
  - python3.11.4: used to to anchor the project and direct all application behavior
  - JavaScript: used to provide the start script needed to run the Code Institute mock terminal in the browser
  - HTML: used to construction the elements involved in building the mock terminal in the browser

### Frameworks/Libraries, Programmes and Tools:
### Python module/packages:
  - random was used to implement pseudo-random number generation.
  - math was used to implement the mathematical operations.
  - os was used to clear the terminal before running the program.

### Third-party imports:
  - Simple Terminal Menu was used to implement the menu.
  - Colorama was used to add colors and styles to the project.
  - Simple term menu was use to create simple menu to ask user to play again or quit.

### Â OTher Tools:
  - Gitpod was used as the main tool to write and edit code.
  - VSCode was used as the plan and practice tool to write and edit code.
  - Git was used for the version control of the website.
  - GitHub was used to host the code of the website.
  - Excel was used to image a flowchart for the README.md file.
  - Code Institute CI Python Linter was use to check the final code.
  - HeroKu was used to deploy the project.

## CI Python Linter Check:

![CI Python Linter Check run.py page](documentation/run_py_page_ci_python_linter_check.png)
  ## Bugs
   - Solved bugs 
  The TicTacToe game does not loop because it places the while loop method in the wrong position. The while loop method has been placed in the bottle of the run.py page to make it work.

   - The instruction content displayed the wrong literacy rule, so I have fixed it by using the f-string instead of the escape character
